PSPGenesis was originally based off Generator(http://www.squish.net/generator/),
with portions taken from Gens32, pgen, and dgen.


The source code was originally going to be released after all major features and bugs
had been implemented and I had a chance to clean up the code so it is in a state suitable
for public viewing. But some (one) of you for one reason or another was desperate to get the
source code and just couldn't wait for the proper release. So I have just zipped up the
current source tree without cleaning up anything.

PSPGenesis started as a test to learn about the psp and all I really wanted to do initially was
see it running my favourite games.
As such, the source code herein is REALLY messy and ugly and full of bad programming practices since
it was never meant to be released in this state. The code was basically thrown in quick and dirty to
get it running. I would advise you to wait for a proper release if you want to do any modifications,
but if you still want to use or modify it, the password is 'understood'. Just keep in mind that the
code was never was meant to be released in the state it is.

If you redistribute this messy source code, please keep this whole zip file intact. And why the
password? It is to make sure you read this text file and understand the state of the source code.
